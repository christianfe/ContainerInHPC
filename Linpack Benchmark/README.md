## Benchmark Overview

The **LINPACK** benchmark measures a system's floating-point computing performance by solving a dense system of linear equations of the form **Ax = b** using **LU decomposition** with partial pivoting.

This benchmark is written in C and uses **double precision** arithmetic. It is widely used to assess the numerical performance of processors and is the basis of the **TOP500** list of the worldâ€™s fastest supercomputers.

During execution, the benchmark performs:
- Generation of a random matrix `A`
- Factorization of `A` using **DGEFA** (LU decomposition)
- Solution of the system using **DGESL**
- Timing and performance reporting over multiple repetitions

## ðŸ“ˆ Benchmark Metrics Explained

The result table contains the following metrics:

| Column     | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Reps**   | Number of repetitions of the benchmark loop |
| **Time(s)**| Total execution time for the given number of repetitions |
| **DGEFA**  | Percentage of time spent in the LU factorization routine (`DGEFA`) |
| **DGESL**  | Percentage of time spent in solving the system (`DGESL`) |
| **OVERHEAD** | Remaining time spent in loop overhead, memory operations, etc. |
| **KFLOPS** | Measured performance in **kilo-FLOPS**, i.e., thousands of floating-point operations per second |

> ðŸ’¡ **Higher KFLOPS means better floating-point performance.**
